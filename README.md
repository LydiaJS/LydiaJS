# Welcome to my github page!
## Who am I?
Hey! I'm Lydia!
I'm a Computer Engineering major at BU with interests in hardware cryptography, cryptanalisys and algorithm design, formal methods, and cybersecurity.
## Why CE and not CS?
I've majored in CS, Computational Mathematics, Philosophy & Linguistics, and Computer Engineering, and so far CE has given the best mix of the things I liked about each of my previous majors, with more oportunities to tinker and see concrete results from my work, which I find especially rewarding.
## What can I find on your github?
Not much
